Pangram Checker
A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet
at least once. Given a sentence, check whether it is a pangram or not.

Write a C/C++ program that returns true if the sentence is a pangram,
otherwise returns false.

Example

“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” -> true
“abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxya” -> false.

Input string sentence
A string containing characters with their ASCII-codes in
the range [32, 127].

Output boolean
true (int value 1) if sentence is a pangram,
false (int value 0) otherwise.

Partial Sequences
If a string contains first occurrences of letters in either
alphabetical or reverse alphabetical sequence, then, it is
considered a partial perfect pangram.
Return true for such sequences.

Example
“abba cab” -> true // first occurrences of characters are in
alphabetical sequence
“fed ceb” -> true // first occurrences of characters
f, e, d, c and b appear in reverse alphabet sequence
