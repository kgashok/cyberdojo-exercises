Instructions
The function that implements a binary search in Python is given in the main.py file. 
It returns bool True if found, and bool False if not found.

Find the Closest

Modify the code to return the number that is closest to the searched number in the list.

If the exact number exists in the list, return the number, as is.

Otherwise, for example, if the search token is 5 and the list contains [1, 3, 6, 9], return 6.

If the search token is 100, and the list contains [1, 3, 5, 9], return 9.

If the search token is 5, and the list contains [1, 3, 7, 9], then both 3 and 7 are equidistant to 5.

In that case, break the tie by returning the number in the higher index, i.e. 7
