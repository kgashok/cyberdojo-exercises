## **What time is it?** 

Imagine a vision enabled robot has to validate the time 
indicated by an analog clock (similar to the one shown 
below). It has the ability to scan any analog clock and 
determine the position of the hour hand and the 
minute hand of the clock. 

Write a function that returns the time as a  formatted 
string,  for e.g.`12:04`, `3:20` or `6.30` (where minutes 
is always in 2 digits), based on the position of  the hour hand 
and the minute hand. The hand positions will be provided as  
angular values. Each angular value `x` where `0` <= `x` <= 
`360`,  would have 
  - `0` degree when hand points to  `12`
  - `90` degree when hand points to `3` and 
  - `180` degree when hand points to `6` 

and so forth. 

### Bonus
Make the calculation to be as quick as possible. And the 
code should also be quite readable as well. 
 
**Clue**: it must be equal to or faster than your own 
brain, and equally elegant in how it goes about it! 

### Extra Bonus 
If the angular value of the hour hand should be greater 
than 360, the string representing the calculated time value 
would have to be returned along with the suffix `pm`. For 
e.g. `3:21pm` or `11.00pm`, etc.
