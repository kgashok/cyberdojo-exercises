"The fundamental string searching (matching) problem 
is defined as follows: given two strings - a text and a pattern, 
determine whether the pattern appears in the text. 
The problem is also known as "the needle in a haystack problem."

indexOf
=======
The function should take three arguments. 
  The first one is the `text` and the other one is the string to
  `pattern`. If `pattern` is available within `text`, then return 
  the index at which it occurs.
 
- If the third argument `first` is 1, then return the index
of the first occurrence. Otherwise, return the index at which the
last occurrence was matched.

If `pattern` is not available, then return -1.

### Example 
- `"abcde", "ab"`   ->  `0`
- `"abcdexy", "xy"` ->  `5`
- `"abcde"`, `"12"` -> `-1`
