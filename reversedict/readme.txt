Write a function that reverses a dictionary, by switching the keys to values, and the values to keys. Because the keys of a dictionary must be unique, you may assume that the values are also unique. For example:
    reverseDictionary({1:2}) => {2:1})
    reverseDictionary({1:2, 3:4}) => {2:1, 4:3})
    reverseDictionary({1:2, 3:4, 7:7, 9:6}) => {2:1, 7:7, 4:3, 6:9})
    
Challenge 1
What if the values are not unique? Collect the keys of those values in a list in ascending order.

Challenge 2
How to handle if the value is a list? 

Challenge 3
How to handle if the value is a list containing duplicates?
