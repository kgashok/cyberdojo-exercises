Airbnb Rotator
 
    This problem was asked by Airbnb.
 
    Given a linked list and a positive integer k, rotate the list to the right by k places.
 
    For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and k = 2, 
                      it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7.
 
    Given the linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 3, 
         it should become 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.
 
    Example
    3 1 5 6 7 -> [6, 7, 5] // shift by 1
 
    4 2 11 22 33 44 -> [33, 44, 11, 22] // shift by 2
 
    rotate_linked_list
 
    Write the code to define the function that will accept two arguments:
 
    - a linked list node which points to the beginning of a linked list and
    - a integer value indicating by how many times the list is to be rotated.
      If this value is not provided, then default it to a value of 1
 
    The function must return the Node which points to the rotated linked list.
