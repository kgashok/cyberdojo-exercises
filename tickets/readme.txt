Description:
 
The new "Thala Ajith" movie has just been released! There are a lot of
people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of 
them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. A "Avengers" ticket 
costs 25 dollars.
 
Vadivel is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket
to every single person in this line.
 
Can Vadivel sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he
initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order 
people follow in the line?
 
Return YES, if Vadivel can sell a ticket to each person and give the 
change. Otherwise return NO.
 
Examples:
 
tickets([25, 25, 50]) # => YES 
tickets([25, 100])    # => NO. Vadivel will not have enough money 
                      # to give change for 100 dollars
 
----------------------------------------
TWIST 1: 
Assume people in line have 10 dollar bills. 
Assume Vadivel carries with him 5 dollar bills (9 in number). 
Modify the logic to accommodate this situation.
