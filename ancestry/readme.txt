=========
Arrays in Javascript have reduce() as an inherent method. 
This allows for some powerful ways of programming. 

Given an array of fruit names, arrive at a one-liner 
function that returns a sorted list of fruit 
names starting with specific letter, and 
joined by a specific delimiter.

Do this in a test driven fashion, working from simple to 
complicated, progressively.

BONUS: 

Now, assume you are provided a fruit inventory as a key:value
pair. Now change the function to output only those fruits 
that are in stock.
