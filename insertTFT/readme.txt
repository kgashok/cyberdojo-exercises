How to learn to perform TFT? 

Recommended programs to practice on 

1. Sequential Search
2. Binary Search
3. InsertionSort 
4. SelectionSort (using recursion, see /selectionsort also)

Insertion Sort: V2 

A Direct TFT Method! 


B Insertion Sort: 

Simplify the algorithm into two steps. 

0. Start with a single element list. Is it already sorted? 

1. Given we have a sorted array, let's add an element to the array. 
We will write the functionality for this first. 

2. If we have 2-element sorted array, we will add a 3rd element using the 
same logic we come up for Step 1

3. If we extend this approach to a n-element array, we will have our algorithm
for Insertion Sort!
